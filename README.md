## Overview

Save My Seat aims to streamline the process of getting seats in classes, many of which are in high demand and reach full capacity quickly. Our goal is to create a user-friendly, interactive platform that facilitates the exchange of classes from student to student through various features, which takes out a lot of the complexity of trying to enroll in a full class. These features include an auctioning feature that allows users to post courses on a billboard, all other app users can see and bid on these courses. The app also has a system to filter and display relevant courses based on the usersâ€™ department and provides a convenient overview of their schedule in calendar format.

### Features
1. You can start auctions for an expansive list of courses and place bids in another auction. You can keep track of which auctions you've started and which auctions you're currently participating in. You're notified of who's the highest bidder on the auctions you host, as well as when you've been outbid on someone else's auction. Users are also able to search through auctions on the global dashboard. 
2. You can look through many of the course offerings at UCLA for the upcoming quarter. Displayed information includes where lectures are located, lecture times and days, final date, the number of units for a class, and how filled the class is.
3. You can add classes to a planner and have the lecture times displayed on a calendar, similar to the myUCLA page. You can also remove the classes from your planner at any time. 

## Running the Application:

### For Linux Users Running Bash:
`git clone https://github.com/HuangEric22/CS35L-Save-My-Seat.git`

`cd CS35L-Save-My-Seat`

`./script.sh`

This should install all of your dependencies. You then need to run:

`cd backend/`

`npm start`

This starts the backend. You then need to open a new terminal:

`cd CS35L-Save-My-Seat`

`cd frontend/`

`npm start`

### For Users on Other Operating Systems:

### Step 1: Clone Repository

`git clone https://github.com/HuangEric22/CS35L-Save-My-Seat.git`

`cd CS35L-Save-My-Seat`

### Step 2: Set Up the Backend

Create a .env file in the **root**. Add port 4000. Add mongodb uri to the .env file which can be created at [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). Add a secret passcode, which can be any string. The .env should look like the following:
```
PORT=4000
MONGO="YOUR_MONGO_DB_URI_HERE"
SECRET="YOUR_SECRET_PASSCODE_HERE"
```

Then run:

`cd backend` 

`npm install` 

`npm start` 

You should receive the message "Connected \n Server Started".


### Step 3: Set up frontend 

`cd frontend` 

`npm install`

`npm start` 

You can view the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.


## For Administrators:

### Setting Up Python Dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/HuangEric22/CS35L-Save-My-Seat.git
cd CS35L-Save-My-Seat
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt
```

The `source venv/bin/activate` creates a virtual environment for Python 
which should be done every time the user creates a new shell if the users
want to isolate the dependencies for this project.

### Running the Scraper:

From there, the user can edit the `department_list` and `term` string in `dataAPI.py` and
insert any department listed in:
`https://registrar.ucla.edu/faculty-staff/courses-and-programs/department-and-subject-area-codes`

When `dataAPI.py` is run, it will print which course from the department (if any) is currently 
being processed and then insert them into the database after every department from the given list
has been processed. Keep in mind the `load_course_data` function expects a list of strings and a string.

You can also fetch major requirements by adding majors to the `requested_majors` list. Keep each entry
as a list separated by commas. Majors should be inputted by only their name, not degree type. So for example:
`Computer Science BS` should be inputted as `Computer Science`.

You can exit the virtual environment by running `deactivate`.
